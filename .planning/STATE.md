## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Next.js 16.1.6 + Supabase + Stripe Embedded Checkout — confirmed stack, no Prisma, no Stripe Connect for v1
- [Init]: Service role key must never reach browser — two separate Supabase client files are a Phase 1 architectural requirement
- [Init]: PostgreSQL exclusion constraint for double-booking — must be in the initial schema migration, cannot be added later without resolving conflicts
- [Init]: "Processing fee" label (not "credit card surcharge") — surcharges are prohibited in CA, CT, ME, MA and on debit cards under Durbin Amendment
- [Init]: Owner onboarding model TBD — self-register vs admin invite decision needed before Phase 2 owner auth is built

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Decide whether owners self-register or are admin-invited before building owner signup flow
- [Phase 6]: Research flag — Stripe Embedded Checkout + ACH bank transfer + CC surcharge implementation has legal and technical nuance; consider /gsd:research-phase before Phase 6 planning
- [Phase 2]: Research flag — Supabase custom access token hook + JWT claims refresh flow has sharp edges; verify current pattern before building owner dashboard
